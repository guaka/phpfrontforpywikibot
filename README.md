pywikibot-web-frontend
======================

This is a PHP frontend to [pywikipediabot](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot).
I wrote some custom code for a project and figured that the same code could be useful to others. It
allows launching specific pywikipediabot scripts and watching progress in an iframe.

This is useful if you want to make specific pywikipediabot
functionality available to folks who can't or don't want to use
commandline tools.

The code is currently pretty custom and adapted to the specific
situation but if there's any interest I'll be happy to help moving
this forward.
