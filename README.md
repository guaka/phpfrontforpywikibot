phpfrontforpywikibot
====================

This is a PHP frontend to pywikipediabot. I wrote some custom code for a project 
that could be useful to others. It allows launching specific pywikipediabot scripts
and watching progress in an iframe.

This is useful if you want to make specific pywikipediabot functionality available
to folks who can't or don't want to use commandline tools.
